Hello.
My name is Timur.
Here is my repo for my scripts and projects.

## Contact Book
Contact book with sqlite3. I wrote it when I started learn Python and SQL.

## Hangman
Just a hangman game ;)

## POE_autoheal
Script for game Path of Exile. "cv2" for scan color on "mss" screen.
"If has no red color, use heal potion"

## POE_notifier
Script for game Path Of Exile. Script parses log file with in-game info, to grab needed and send it to Telegram bot (or something that you want, you can change script)
(If you can, review this code and contact with me. Ive been learning yet, and it would be great to know how i can write this code better)
