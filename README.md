# RickPetProjects
Hello.
My name is Timur.
Here is my repo for my petprojects.

## Contact Book
The very first project is a contact book with sqlite3. I wrote it when I started learn Python and SQL.

## POE_autoheal
The second project is a script for game Path of Exile. "cv2" for scan color on "mss" screen.
"If has no red color, use heal potion"

## POE_notifier
The Third project is a script for game Path Of Exile. Script parses log file with in-game info, to grab needed and send it to Telegram bot (or something that you want, you can change script)
